        <h2>Introduction to Shoulder Dislocations</h2>
        <p>Shoulder dislocations are a common injury that can happen to anyone, from athletes to
            everyday individuals. It occurs when the top part of the arm bone slips out of its socket in the
            shoulder. This can be very painful and make arm movement difficult. However, with proper care
            and physiotherapy, most people can return to their normal activities.</p>

        <h2>Understanding Shoulder Dislocations</h2>
        <p>A shoulder dislocation occurs when the round part of the upper arm bone (called the
            humerus) slips out of the socket in the scapula. This can happen in various ways, but the most
            common is the arm bone slipping forward out of the socket. This is called an anterior dislocation
            and accounts for approximately 95-98% of all shoulder dislocations.</p>

    <section id="attention">
        <h2>Immediate Attention and Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>When you dislocate your shoulder, the first thing you should do is stay calm. Do not try
            to push the bone back into place yourself; this should be done by a doctor or trained
            professional. While waiting for help, try to keep your arm still.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="evaluation">
        <h2>Initial Physiotherapy Evaluation</h2>
        <p>After the shoulder is placed back into position, a physiotherapy evaluation is crucial.
            This helps determine the extent of injury to the surrounding muscles and ligaments.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="recovery">
        <h2>Recovery Stages</h2>
        <p>Recovery includes pain management, restoring range of motion, and strengthening
            exercises to stabilize the joint and prevent recurrence.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="prevention">
        <h2>Prevention of Recurrent Dislocations</h2>
        <p>Strengthening the shoulder muscles and avoiding risky activities can help prevent
            future dislocations. Regular physiotherapy check-ups are recommended.</p>

    <section id="faq">
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
        <p><strong>How is a shoulder dislocation treated?</strong> A medical professional will
            reposition the bone and recommend a recovery plan, often including physiotherapy.</p>
        <p><strong>How long does it take to recover?</strong> Recovery typically takes several
            weeks to months, depending on the severity and adherence to rehabilitation.</p>
